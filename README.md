# Step-counting
The step counting is based on minimal peak distance, minimal peak prominence, dynamic thresholding and vibration elimination in combination with peak detection and periodicity, similarity features. It solves over-counting, under-counting and false walking problems and requires a low computation cost.
We have been published 4 files on github.com, it includes: 500steps_1; Our Proposed Method 500 steps detected over 500 steps execution_1.p; 500steps_2; Our Proposed Method 498 steps detected over 500 steps execution_2.p

500steps_1 and 500steps_2 are two recorded data by volunteers in free walking with 500 steps
Our Proposed Method 500 steps detected over 500 steps execution_1.p and Our Proposed Method 498 steps detected over 500 steps execution_2.p are step counting results by our proposed method which simulated on Matlab software.
